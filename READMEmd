Usually comes back to Github after multiple months, these are canon events :D
Sometimes I lay down on my bed, and my eyes are closing, then I feels bad about how I waste my time, then I go check my Github and do some code, and that cycle repeats but each cycle took few months 😃

Something about me (not professional at all):

I do Python 😫
I also do some HTML and CSS 👾
I maybe interested in JS webapp(s) which could you across devices because I hate the unsync UI, I want them to look ✨like each-others✨
I love Hackintosh on some of my PCs when I am boring 🍎
I am lazy (true) 😴
